The Posterchild Of Progressive Music; The Album That Opened My Eyes
When sitting down to review OK Computer, I really had to think about what I wanted to say. Everything that could ever be said about this album has been said a hundred thousand times more eloquently and effectively than I ever could. But then again, if you are affected by a piece of music, more specifically, a piece of art, why should you not feel entitled to express your thoughts about that art? The thing about OK Computer, it's such a seminal beast in the face of influential and emotional music that it's hard to sum up in a mere review...so I'm going to do my best. There is a reason, after all, that this is the number one ranked album of all time on Rate Your Music's chart. Without further ado, I give you my thoughts.

I was born in the nineties, right when Radiohead was first becoming the huge, international success that they would soon be known as, and the legend that their name holds in the industry these days. So, yeah, I was only about three years old when OK Computer was released. I wasn't there to hear it for the first time like so many others. I wasn't there to slide the audio cassette of OK Computer into my car's cassette player and slowly let my jaw drop as the tidal waves of ambience would so inevitably slide into the ears of millions and infect their musical tastes...and their ideas of music as an art form. With that being said, I grew up enjoying a wide variety of music, and slowly and assuredly, my musical tastes expanded like so many others had. I had my years of discovery where I stumbled (ala the Linkin Park and Disturbed days), but eventually, my ears sought to discover the world beyond the close encapsulated walls of radio rock music...there was something so cliché and worn out about much of the music that those stations played that I remember my father drumming along in the car to in my youth. I was a child born of circumstance...and eventually I broke those boundaries and ventured far into the progressive fields of unconventional music. I think the first step I made towards true self-discovery of my actual tastes and of creative, artistic music was with Nirvana's Nevermind. The moment I heard the rawness of those guitars and Kurt Cobain's shattered screams and yells...I was captivated. Through the years I gained a foot in the vast array of independent and progressive music that I had so often seen, heard, or glanced it on the internet. And like many circumstantial children of 90's radio rock, I first heard of Radiohead with their commercial success, Creep. Even though that song was far from what Radiohead truly was, and what I had no idea they would come to mean to me later in life, I adored it.

Then through the years, I downloaded The Bends, Kid A, and OK Computer. Initially, because Rolling Stone magazine had named Kid A as their album of the decade...you see where I was coming from now?
With Kid A, I never truly understood the hype. I thought it was, yet another overrated, overhyped, overindulgent piece of drivel that this music industry seemed to deem art. Then again, I was only thirteen at the time. But unlike many a peer my age, I wasn't one of the thirteen year olds obsessed with billboard, bubblegum pop, or marketed cheap sounding hip-hop. Bands like Nirvana, Pearl Jam, and Smashing Pumpkins helped begin the expansion of my tastes at an early age.

It actually wasn't until a couple of years ago that I was actually genuinely affected by OK Computer. I had enjoyed songs like, Karma Police, Paranoid Android, and even No Surprises to a certain extent. This was before I re-listened to the album to understand its revery and honor in the music world. But upon re-listening to the album for the first time since I downloaded it at the age of thirteen, I noticed something. The songs all did seem to carry a cohesive place together. They all seemed to flow into one another. Each song was incredibly unique and distinct. I was a little baffled that I hadn't noticed this before.
So, after I listened to it for the first time, out of sheer curiosity and infatuation, I listened to the entire album immediately after having just finished doing so. This time...it was like a lightbulb went off in my head. As if I had some sort of sudden epiphany and realization of what I was actually listening to. I think the moment that I had this sudden realization was when Thom Yorke goes into that beautiful falsetto on Exit Music (For A Film). I realized it was the most beautiful piece of music I had ever heard. I was giddy, like a kid in a candy store with unlimited funds. I felt like I could literally reach and out and touch this music physically with my hands. It had such a body to it, such a heart, such a soul. It was profound and completely enthralling. For the remainder of that listen, I was glued to my computer, with my headphones a harbinger of lush noises and sounds bouncing around one another in some odd, genius perfection. I loved how the band worked together as a cohesive unit, allowing each and every member to compliment one another...allowing each and every member their own moments of recognition. I loved the sweeping melodies and incredible arrangements. Immediately after I had finished listening, I looked up the song lyrics for the album and discovered how deep and meaningful they all were...and how these song lyrics that inhabited each song on the album, all tied together with one another on the album to create, more or less, a story of isolation and alienation, of despondence and frustration, of disintegration and decay of society, but also, of beauty, romanticism, and love of small facets of the world around.

After I had finished that listen of OK Computer in deep analyzation and contemplation, I understood it. I 'got it'. The album, the music, and its deep, intrinsic meanings hit me like a slug to the chest. My world was changed. OK Computer, in that moment, was both life changing and life affirming. It was everything that my tastes had been searching for in an album for so long, but had not the slightest clue...and it was right in front of my eyes for the longest time.

I discovered that OK Computer's inception was based upon a deepseated disinterest and disarray from the society around it. It was an album that saw the future ahead of it, and bore it like a cataclysmic foreshadowing of sound and destructive emotion. It was kind of like reading Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury for the first time. It just kind of changes you. It enlightens you. It opens your eyes. It shows you how frail and shallow almost everything around you is, and how every day the society that everyone seemingly praises, is collapsing upon its own self indulgence. I guess I knew that before OK Computer came into my life, but then again, everything just clicked thrice-fold in my brain after having fell in love with this incredible creation.

It was an album about insightful, introspective, and analytical people who could see the rampant problems in society, hiding behind the thin veil of plastic smiles and radiant faces. Plastic surgery, public transport, the ideas of love in modern society, the fakeness and shallow nature of much of everything around it, the strive for progression in technology that was and is slowly tearing society apart on its own seems. These are many of the themes of OK Computer.
As society strives towards perfecting technology and using its beneficiaries to its advantage, it fails to see itself losing its own fragile humanity in the centerfold. And I think that that is much of what OK Computer is about, as a musical expression, and a social statement. It beckons for a return to real, raw, genuine, emotional, human qualities and aspects in society. And then you have parts of the album that entail the inevitable descent into paranoia and even further to insanity, due to the broken plastic shell that civilization brings on with its lucrative focus on advancement and security, rather than maintaining actual human morals and characteristics.

I think the album has a lot of commentary on the idea of the "android". And more or less, I believe Radiohead placed the idea of an "android", or "robot" into the album so often because it is nothing less than the epitome of everyone that the society in which Radiohead illustrates are headed to become. "I'm paranoid, but I'm not an android", is a perfect example. And maybe, with a bit of a subjective analyzation, this is pointing towards the idea of human beings that are so obsessed with this dangerous idea of technology, that they are slowly turning into these androids, controlled by the technology they once sought to use to their benefit. So maybe, in the end, the message of a song so epic as "Paranoid Android", is perhaps its better to be paranoid than to let oneself disintegrate and formulate in the cogs of society's machinery, and let oneself become nothing less of an android. The fragile humanity that Radiohead so endearingly brings to life, are a bunch that believe they are free with all of their advancements in civilization and technology and culture, yet they fail to see that it is all a frail mask brought on by the 'society' that is controlling their every action. Sound familiar? Well, Radiohead could see the future coming from a million miles away, and so, they set about using that very destructive technology that they despised so dearly, to create this masterpiece that we have today. They wanted to show their listeners, and perhaps, non-listeners that the freedom everyone held so highly was a blight that was ever-so-steadily playing with fire.

Even more than that, I think that OK Computer places a lot of emphasis on a sort of unsatisfied and insightful character...one who sees through all the thin plastic veils of indulgence. I think that the character Radiohead are trying to convey, with their lyrical depth and their musical tone, is someone deeply isolated and alienated from everything and everyone around. He or she is a person that, against the wishes of society, chooses to maintain their humanity in a time of fleeting values and character. This is where the album becomes not just a prophetic siren song for the future (the ensuing 21st Century at the time of this record's release), but also an incredibly relatable, emotional, personal, and intimate summary of someone who feels deep dissatisfaction in their lives. Someone who is shattered and broken by their peers and by their environment. Someone who is desperately vying to break free from that place of anguish. And I think that is an incredibly relatable theme for many people. It's as if Radiohead have this vision of a Bruce Springsteen Born To Run type character, only set in a futuristic society, in a different time and place. I think the album has a lot of commentary on that of introverts and lonely people. Wide-eyed, emotionally unstable subway sitters and public transport junkies, window starer types, that embody much of that same isolation and despondence that Radiohead seem to feel so intimately connected to. It allows for almost any type of person to access this album and find an immediate connection with it, even if they are unfamiliar or turned off by the thought of experimental rock layered with electronics.

It is an incredible motif, and Radiohead do an exceedingly brilliant job at conveying these messages with their even more brilliant musical production. The music itself on "OK Computer" should never be understated. This isn't just a beloved album because of its messages about society and its symptoms of isolation and hollowness. There are many other albums that have themes and messages much like OK Computer. No, what seemingly sets OK Computer apart from the other experimental artsy alternative groups in the genre, is their masterful attention to detail when it comes to their music and sounds.

Radiohead are a band that are constantly evolving, a band that gets off to the thought of reinvention and challenging their fan base. And with that, their entire discography is a constant shift in sounds, tones, ideas, and experimenting. With their debut, Pablo Honey, they were met with very mediocre critical acclaim. Had they not strived for more and probed their inner-genius, then we might be looking back at a band famous for its one-hit-wonder. But instead of simply settling for second rate, Radiohead went on to produce The Bends, one of the best guitar rock and alternative-centric albums of the nineties. With that album, they blew heads away. Critics and fans alike were awe inspired that such a mundane band could go on to craft such a fantastic record. But they did.

But even after that, Radiohead weren't satisfied with sticking to one definitive sound and in a shallow way, capitalizing upon it like so many other derivative bands have done. Instead, they understood that to keep their music fresh, to keep their music original, and to become the influential, groundbreaking centerpiece of the music world that they are today; they knew that they had to explore new ideas of reinvention and progression. Taking cues from other critically acclaimed artists (The Beatles, David Bowie, Pink Floyd, DJ Shadow, Can, etc.) who had also understood that reinvention and unconventional deviations from the norm are key to progression and originality in music, the early ideas for their masterpiece, and eventually, the world's masterpiece began.

So, with OK Computer, an album that appeared at the helm of the nineties, (a decade already ruled in original, experimental music) all of the pieces lined up in perfect symmetry for once, almost as if they were to set to fall into such a circumstance. With all of these frustrations and angers, all of these feelings of isolation and despondence from this slowly dwindling society, they created an album that would go down in history as legend because of all of that existential angst and crisis. Thom Yorke's howling vocals and beautiful range showcase the album's voice. It is a voice of desperation and disappointment, but also a voice drenched in fear and uncertainty of what the future was set to hold. With all of these emotions and all of this artistic vision, Thom Yorke perfectly inclines with the beautiful instrumentation at hand.

Speaking of the beautiful instrumentation, that may just be the album's defining characteristic. Because, behind all of its deep, intellectual and introspective themes and ideas, behind all of its layers and cacaphonies; there is one thing that OK Computer is heralded for more than anything else. And that is its incredible influence on music as a whole. Perhaps, an album that was released perfectly for its place in the genre. It came trodding along right as britpop was coming to its mighty end, and bands like Pulp, Oasis, and Blur weren't producing the same quality records that they once had. It came upon in a time of great musical change, both in stylistic approach and in purpose.

As it was released in 1997, the musicality that shines through on OK Computer was like nothing anyone in the music world had ever heard, nor had dreamed could ever work together in an album. The boys who had once released the infamous, "Creep" song, had no less than redefined a genre of music listeners and music creators in that same decade. Even today, OK Computer's influence can be seen far and wide in the industry. Bands like Coldplay, Keane, and Muse owe the entirety of their sound to Radiohead. Believe it or not, back in the day, alternative music didn't automatically include the use of electronics and synths. This is mainly due to the fact that Radiohead had a vision of a different alternative music landscape, and so, with OK Computer they saw their biggest departure from the days of the 'guitar, drums, bass, repeat' cycle. And while that cycle in alternative and rock music is timeless and has always been seminal and most likely, always will be, Radiohead's sheer inventive force and insightful originality in their use of electronics working with those classic instruments was spellbinding and awe-inspiring for the music world. Little things like this all accumulate to make OK Computer the master class of musicianship that it is.

And that's without even going into deep detail about Johnny Greenwood's redefining use of the guitar in alternative music, as he creates electronic and synth effects with his sharp skill and honed ability. Their sharp and forward thinking use of electronics in tandem with guitar rock helped light a fuse that had just been sparked before by other artists. This fuse exploded and fully took flight in the 21st century. In many ways, there were a lot of great albums that take direct creative inspiration and design from OK Computer, but then again, there is a pile brimming with deplorable ones as well. Nevertheless, one cannot argue the influence that this album has had on modern music. The funny thing is...if asked about how they would be viewed in ten years time before the release of OK Computer, I'm quite positive that Radiohead would have never guessed, nor could they foresee how encompassing and legendary their names would go down in music history.

Lastly, the songs themselves on OK Computer...well they're something else aren't they? Each and every last song is notable on its own merits, as each one is entirely unique. No one song sounds alike to any other song, yet they all seem to flow into one another in perfect harmony, like the soundtrack to the collapse of a futuristic society...a society that Radiohead brings to life that feels not too far off might I add.

With each and every song, there's a hundred thousand different sounds, and the attention to detail is easily conceivable when you play the record for the fourteenth time and are still noticing slight details in the songs. From "Airbag", the opener, which is perhaps one of Radiohead's finest songs on its own merits. The guitar that opens the album is simply jaw dropping and brings a smile to my face. While the lyrics, which are intern much darker by all means. "I am an interstellar burst. I am back to save the universe." A lot of Radiohead's music has certain ambiguous qualities to it (a.k.a Kid A), but there's just something about that line that makes me shiver every time I hear it. It's almost like a siren song, a mission statement for the album, to me. As if the music at hand is actually larger than life, and is in place to provide a warning and a calling card all the same, for the album.

I won't talk about each and every song in detail, since this review is already much too long, and I've already exhausted expunging my passion and love for this record to the grave. But as the album continues, you have "Paranoid Android", which is ALMOST, the song of the album. It's a song that fully summarizes this album, or at least I think so. It has been called, by many, as Radiohead's "Stairway To Heaven". That's a statement that I completely disprove, considering "Paranoid Android" is a song that is leagues ahead of anything Led Zeppelin ever created. Yet, I can see why some people would believe that. It has this incredible bending of tempos and structures throughout, and all throughout I believe it details the slow descent into paranoia due to society's urgencies and pressures. It's a song about how that paranoia may be more freeing than falling victim to the cycle of conformity that the 'androids' are so inclined to. Tracks like, "Exit Music (For A Film)" (which is apparently a song about Romeo and Juliet), prove that Radiohead has the ability to craft some of the most haunting music you'll ever hear. As it begins slowly and softly and foreshadows something much grimmer, it pulls you in, only to throw you for a loop towards the end where "all hell breaks loose". Then you have, "Let Down". This is my favorite track on the album. It's just simply perfect. It's one of the most beautiful expressions of disdain and despondence that I have ever heard, as we hear Thom serenade some of his most tasteful vocals ever over a story of "transport, motorways, and tramlines", and in the end, how disappointing and depressing it all is. Then you have fan favorites such as, "Karma Police" (a haunting tale of censorship and restriction), "Climbing Up The Walls" (a headfirst nosedive into a frighteningly realistic take on insanity), "No Surprises" (a song about the dissatisfaction of day job life and its pressures, as well as a testimony about the fake nature of many people in society due to the place of plastic surgery and cosmetics erasing our humanity), and then of course, there's, "Fitter, Happier", a song that I believe to be criminally underrated. While, yes, it isn't a full-fletched song like the others on the album, I believe that the song plays its part perfectly. Voiced by an android like character that carries a very unsettling nature, "Fitter, Happier" is more or less a reading of day to day normalities and pressures of modern society, and how they all more or less, tie together to unhinge one's humanity and turn them into the very android that narrates this unsettling monologue.

Overall, I really can't think of a short summary for OK Computer. Because it is an album that deserves so much more than a few words. It's an album that deserves to be praised more and more with every passing year as its sheer influence can be seen far and wide. It's also an album that through all the beautiful instrumentation and innovative use of production, has so very much to say. About the modern world, about society, about the dangers of technology, about humanity, morality, love, censorship, and further existentialist ideas and thoughts. It's simply the most perfect album that I've ever heard. I know that it's an undying cliché to say this, but OK Computer is my favorite album of all time, like so many other people. But in this case, this is a cliché that works. It's because this album is that damned good. It's so well thought out, well made and executed, that for anyone to say that it's their favorite album ever made...they have ever right. Music owes a lot to Radiohead. And so do I, as this album opened my eyes like I had never seen before to the bouquets of genres and styles of music at my access. So just for that, I'd like to thank Radiohead...if not for anything else to begin with. No one ever anticipated that in the late nineties, the guys who put out "Creep", would go on to produce one of the most widely regarded and critically acclaimed albums ever created...but they did. I don't know if they'll ever top it, but who knows. It just goes to show, that the best things in life truly are not predictable.
